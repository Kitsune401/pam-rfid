.SH NAME
PAM RFID - Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) for hardware authentication via RFID

.SH DESCRIPTION
PAM RFID is a Python written Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) which uses \fBpam_python\fR to work with operating system like a native C module. It allows hardware (passwordless) authentication with a UART compatible RFID sensor using the EM4100 protocol. The connection to the RFID sensor will be established via \fBPyserial\fR. A default USB TTL converter can be used to connect the device. PAM RFID was developed with the RDM6300 RFID reader.
.br

Per default the standard password authentication is set as fallback in case no RFID sensor is connected. The module has to be configured by the \fBpamrfid-conf\fR program. It allows (as root) to bind or unbind users to PAM RFID. To simulate an authentication process the \fBpamrfid-check\fR program can be used.
